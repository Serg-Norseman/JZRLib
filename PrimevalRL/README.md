The idea of this game is inspired by the TV series "Primeval". I would like 
a turnbased roguelike game. In the style of games for survival. A small town, 
the residence of the hero of the game. Periodically appear portals at other 
times. Appearing in some place, the portal will exist for a while, disappear, 
and then periodically appear in the same place and give a pass to the same 
time as for the first time. Portals can appear both in the original time 
(present) and in the times visited by the player.

## Keys

A screen with keys and other help is called up in the game using the `h` key.
