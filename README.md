The idea of this game is inspired by the TV series "Primeval". I would like a turnbased roguelike game. In the style of games for survival.

A small town, the residence of the hero of the game. Periodically appear portals at other times. Appearing in some place, the portal will exist for a while, disappear, and then periodically appear in the same place and give a pass to the same time as for the first time. Portals can appear both in the original time (present) and in the times visited by the player.

If the player's character dies, its profile is deleted. But the player can continue to play as another resident of the original city, or to generate a new reality.
